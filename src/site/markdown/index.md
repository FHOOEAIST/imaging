# Imaging

The imaging framework provides different functionality in the context of image processing and computer vision.

## Notes
The imaging project highly uses Project Lombok. So if you use IntelliJ for development, it is recommended to install the [Lombok IntelliJ plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/6317-lombok/).
                                                                                
  * Install lombok plugin: File -> Settings -> Plugins -> Search for Lombok -> Install Lombok  
  * Activate Annotation Processor: File -> Settings -> Build, Execution, Deployment -> Compiler -> Annotation Processor -> Enable annotation processing  

## Functionality

This project provides image processing, computer vision and geometric methods.
The basis is the API module which contains 2D and 3D domain classes. The lowest common denominator of those domain classes are 3D respectively 2D points.

The functionality is separated into two main modules with sub modules, described below.

 * **api**: Is the base module of the imaging project containing **domain objects** for images, geometric figures (e.g. points, lines, rectangles, ...), color representations and more. Also contains some further functionality as interfaces, transformers and utility classes (e.g. for type checking of images). 
 * **core**: Core consists of basic implementations for image and geometric processing. [See here for a more detailed description...](service/service_core.md )
 * **imagej**: Connector module to [ImageJ](https://imagej.net/)
 * **nd4j**: Connector module to [ND4J](https://github.com/deeplearning4j/nd4j)
 * **microsoftcognitiveservices**: This module wraps the functionality of MicrosoftÂ´s Cognitive Services and is currently used for face detection.
 * **opencv**: This module is the core computer vision implementation and uses the [AistCV (OpenCV Java Wrapper)](https://github.com/FHOOEAIST/aistcv) [See here for a more detailed description...](service/opencv_module.md)
 * **openimaj**: Connector module to [OpenIMAJ](http://openimaj.org/)
 * **tesseract**: This module covers OCR methods based on the [javacpp](https://github.com/bytedeco/javacpp-presets) wrapper of the [tesseract framework](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract).
 * **pdfbox**: This module provides some .pdf file functionality based on org.apache.pdfbox

## Image Definitions

### Image wrappers

We currently have wrapper implementations for the following images, all of them can only be created using the specific `ImageFactory`, that are in turn obtained from typed based `ImageFactoryFactory`.

![imagefactory](documentation/imagefactory.png)

#### API Module

* `ImageWrapper<Short[][][]>` (`Image2ByteFactory`): Image type using 2-bytes per pixel. That leads to low storage requirements. Use e.g. the factory's image provider `Image2ByteFactory` to create one. Note that also if the basic pixel based set/get methods are double based, the floating point precision is lost with this type of image!
* `ImageWrapper<Double[][][]>` (`Image8ByteFactory`): Image type using 8-bytes per pixel. Concern the high storage requirements - only use it if really necessary! Use e.g. the factory's image provider `Image8ByteFactory` to create one.
* `ImageWrapper<BufferedImage>` (`BufferedImageFactory`): Implementation for connecting Java's `BufferedImage` to our framework. Use e.g. the factory's image provider `BufferedImageFactory` to create one.

**Note:** Usually use the ```Image2ByteFactory``` to get a 2 byte precision image (```ImageWrapper<short[][][]>```), the 8 byte precision image (```ImageWrapper<double[][][]>```) should only be used in special cases, when the floating point precision is required, because of the increased storage requirements.

#### OpenCV Module
* `ImageWrapper<Mat>` (`OpenCVFactory`): Represents the interface from our imaging framework to the OpenCV framework (based on the [AistCV](https://github.com/FHOOEAIST/aistcv) wrapper). You can also use the factory's image provider `OpenCVFactory` to create one.

In addition to the base `ImageWrapper` there is also a `SubImageWrapper`class, that represents a ROI of a referenced image.

#### ImageJ Module

* `ImageWrapper<ImageProcessor>` (`ImageProcessorFactory`): Wrapper implementation to ImageJ's [ImageProcessor](https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/developer/api/ij/process/ImageProcessor.html), that supports images with 1 to 3 channels.
* `ImageWrapper<ImageStack>` (`ImageStackFactory`):: Wrapper implementation to ImageJ's [ImageStack](https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/developer/api/ij/ImageStack.html), that are stacked [ImageProcessor](https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/developer/api/ij/process/ImageProcessor.html)s of same size.

#### ND4j Module

* `ImageWrapper<INDArray>` (`IndArrayFactory`): Wrapper implementation to ND4J's [INDArray](https://deeplearning4j.org/api/latest/org/nd4j/linalg/api/ndarray/INDArray.html).

#### OpenIMAJ Module

* `ImageWrapper<MBFImage>` (`MBFImageFactory`): Wrapper implementation to OpenIMAJ's [MBFImage](http://openimaj.org/apidocs/org/openimaj/image/MBFImage.html).
* `ImageWrapper<FImage>` (`FImageFactory`): Wrapper implementation to OpenIMAJ's [FImage](http://openimaj.org/apidocs/org/openimaj/image/FImage.html).

### Image function

The API module contains the ```ImageFunction``` interface, which is considered as basis for image processing methods. Using this interface allows us to create image processing chains, which are easy to read and also more efficient (Java garbage collector is able to close resources faster), see example below. Current implementations still have to be adapted as far as possible, but this is a bit of future thinking. 

```Java
// Example from the PASS project, which uses OpenCVDistanceMap implementation.
ImageFunction.closeAfterApply(openCVDistanceMap)
                         .compose((Function<JavaImage, ImageWrapper<Mat>>) imageTransformer::from)
                         .andThen(ImageFunction.closeAfterApply(GraphStructuralElementToGraphRoomTransformer::openCVDistanceMapToJava))
                         .apply(ji);

// Example from Image2ByteSaver
new BufferedImageSaver()
                        .accept(((Function<ImageWrapper<short[][][]>, ImageWrapper<double[][][]>>)transformer8ByteTo2Byte::to)
                        .andThen(image8ByteToBufferedImageTransformer::to)
                        .apply(image), fileName);

```

### Coordinate System

In the imaging project we are using a classic image coordinate system with a top/left origin.

![Image Coordinate system](documentation/image-coordinate-system.png)

### Color Ranges

The following color ranges are used inside the imaging project:

  * binary: (0, 255)
  * greyscale: (0 - 255)
  * rgb/bgr: (0-255) (0-255) (0-255)
  * hsv: (0.0 - 360.0) (0.0 - 1.0) (0.0 - 1.0)
  * yuv: (0.0 - 1.0) (-1.0 - 1.0) (-1.0 - 1.0)
  * luv: (0.0 - 100.0), (-134.0 - 220.0), (-140.0 - 122.0)

## Architecture of geometric domain classes

In the Imaging project we are using a coordinate system with x-axis for width information (abscissa axis), y-axis for length information (ordinata axis) and z-axis for height information (applica axis). This can be seen in the following coordinate systems.

![Coordinate systems](documentation/coordinate-systems.png)

The base class of the geometric classes is **AbstractJavaPoint** with its derivates **JavaPoint3D** and **JavaPoint2D**. The **JavaPoint2D** hides the z-coordinate.
All other geometric classes are reusing either the 3D or the 2D point respectively another class wrapping those classes.
The architecture consists of abstract base classes contained in `science.aist.imaging.api.domain`, which are implemented for 3D purposes in `science.aist.imaging.api.domain.threedimensional` and for 2D purposes in `science.aist.imaging.api.domain.twodimensional`.
All 2D domain classes end with 2D in the name and all 3D domain classes with 3D.
The other main geometric classes are:

  * AbstractJavaLine: Representing a line between two points
  * AbstractJavaPolygon: Representing any area defined by a given line-strip
  * AbstractJavaPointCloud: Representing any amount of points
 
**Note** the semantic difference between `AbstractJavaPointCloud` and `AbstractJavaPolygon`, where the first one represents any unordered amount of points, and a polygon represents an ordered list of points, which are connected defined by the order.

All geometric domain classes are **rich** classes with different functions and are **unmodifiable**. 

The rough architecture (without the domain functions) of the most important domain classes looks like:
