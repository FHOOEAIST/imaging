# Core

The core module contains the base interfaces for most of the image processing functionality implemented in the different sub modules as the opencv module.

## Software Architecture

The imaging project highly sticks to a functional-like programming style. For this reason most of the functionality is based on Java's `Function` or `Consumer` interface. Functions return new images and donÂ´t touch the given object, while consumers apply changes directly onto the given object.

The core implementations are highly generic so any `ImageWrapper` implementation can be used with most of them. For this reason many function classes require an injected `ImageFactory` to create the result image. The input type can be wildcards most of the time. So if you want to use a `GaussFilter` which takes any input image and results in a `BufferedImage` wrapper use it like this:

```java
GaussFilterFunction<?, BufferedImage> gaussFilterFunction = new GaussFilterFunction<>(ImageFactoryFactory.getImageFactory(BufferedImage.class));
ImageWrapper<BufferedImage> result = gaussFilterFunction.apply(input);
```
